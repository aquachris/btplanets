game [BATTLETECH](https://community.battletechgame.com/forums) by [Harebrained Schemes](http://harebrained-schemes.com/),
most notably the BATTLETECH game logo and the house and faction sigils. The author understands these assets

## What is this?

### The Inner Sphere
The Inner Sphere is the human-inhabited part of space in the science fiction universe of BattleTech. It is
described to be a spherical region centered on the Sol system and extending roughly 500 light years outwards in all
directions, containing roughly 2000 - 3000 star systems (depending on whether formerly inhabited and
periphery worlds are included).

Since all available depictions show a two-dimensional starmap despite the "sphere" moniker, the consensus is to regard
the Inner Sphere as essentially 2D (accompanied by the fluff explanation that all maps are simply 2D projections
of 3D space).

### The year 3025
The BattleTech universe is rich in history, and there are many interesting eras to explore. However, the quintessential
era (at least to table top players from the 80s and 90s like yours truly) is the time of the late
Succession Wars, marked by technological decline ("LosTech") and the Macchiavellian politics of the five Successor
States and their lords.

The year 3025 marks the end of the Third Succession War and sees the five major powers locked in a stalemate, exhausted
from centuries of war. Despite the uneasy cease-fire between the combatants, there are plenty of localized conflicts
for the domination of single planets, not to forget the ongoing struggles with bandits and minor states in the periphery.
The Successor States, burned out as they are, are trying to conserve their military assets and oftentimes employ
mercenary companies to fight their battles.

In contrast to previous wars which were fought with giant armies and countless anonymous soldiers, combat in this era is
much more up close and personal. This is due to BattleMechs ruling the battlefield - 30-foot-tall robots, highly
mobile, heavily armored and armed to the teeth. If controlled by a skilled pilot, a BattleMech is the equivalent of an
entire company of lesser machines or infantry. Convential wisdom says that the best way to combat a BattleMech is another
BattleMech, which means that most battles consist of a limited number of Mechs fighting each other to decide the
outcome of the entire conflict.

### An interactive map
I've always wanted to be able to explore the BattleTech universe visually from a top-down perspective, starting with an
overview of the entire Inner Sphere and having the option to zoom in to interesting points. Another interesting use case
is plotting jump routes and estimating the travel time between two systems.

I was inspired by the upcoming game [BATTLETECH](http://battletechgame.com/) and hope that the map will help newcomers to
familiarize themselves with the universe quickly and enjoyably.
