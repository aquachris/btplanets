btplanets is a non-profit open source fan project for the BattleTech universe. It uses data from the public 
fan Wiki at www.sarna.net, as well as several art assets from the community forums of the upcoming computer 
game [BATTLETECH](https://community.battletechgame.com/forums) by [Harebrained Schemes](http://harebrained-schemes.com/), 
most notably the BATTLETECH game logo and the house and faction sigils. The author understands these assets

## What is this?

### The Inner Sphere
The Inner Sphere is the human-inhabited part of space in the science fiction universe of BattleTech. It is 
described to be a spherical region centered on the Sol system and extending roughly 500 light years outwards in all 
directions, containing roughly 2000 - 3000 star systems (depending on whether formerly inhabited and 
periphery worlds are included).

Since all available depictions show a two-dimensional starmap despite the "sphere" moniker, the consensus is to regard 
the Inner Sphere as essentially 2D (accompanied by the fluff explanation that all maps are simply 2D projections 
of 3D space).

### The year 3025
The BattleTech universe is rich in history, and there are many interesting eras to explore. However, the quintessential 
era (at least to table top players from the 80s and 90s like yours truly), is the time of the late
Succession Wars, marked by technological decline ("LosTech") and the Macchiavellian politics of the five Successor 
States and their lords.

The year 3025 marks the end of the Third Succession War and sees the five major powers locked in a stalemate, exhausted
from centuries of war. Despite the uneasy cease-fire between the combatants, there are plenty of localized conflicts 
for the domination of single planets, not to forget the ongoing struggles with bandits and minor states in the periphery. 
The Successor States, burned out as they are, are trying to conserve their military assets and oftentimes employ 
mercenary companies to fight their battles.

In contrast to previous wars that were fought with giant armies and countless anonymous soldiers, combat in this era is 
much more up close and personal. This is due to BattleMechs ruling the battlefield - 30-foot-tall armored robots, highly 
mobile and well armed. If controlled by a skilled pilot, a BattleMech is the equivalent of an entire company of lesser 
machines or infantry.

### An interactive map
I've always wanted to be able to explore the BattleTech universe visually from a top-down perspective, starting with an 
overview of the Inner Sphere and having the option of zooming in to interesting points.

Since browsers and the d3 library make it pretty easy to achieve an interactive 2D map nowadays, this is what I've done here.
